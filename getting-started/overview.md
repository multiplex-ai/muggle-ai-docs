Muggle Test is an AI-powered web testing platform that discovers user flows in your product and keeps them covered with executable tests.

## When to use Muggle Test

- You ship changes to your web app weekly or faster.
- You do not want to maintain a large end-to-end test suite by hand.
- You care about realistic, user-centric coverage instead of brittle DOM selectors.

## What you get

- Automatically discovered user flows (login, CRUD, search, dashboards, and more).
- Executable test scripts that can be re-run on every change.
- Human-readable reports that your whole team can understand.

## How it fits into your workflow

- **Before release**: run generated tests against staging to catch regressions.
- **After release**: schedule regular runs to make sure critical flows keep working.
- **During development**: quickly verify that new features did not break existing journeys.
