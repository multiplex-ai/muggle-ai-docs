Muggle Test is an AI-powered web testing platform that discovers realistic user flows and keeps them covered with executable tests.

This short page gives you a quick map of the documentation and suggests a path depending on what you are trying to do.

## If you are brand new

- Start with **[Muggle Test Overview](./overview.md)** for a high-level introduction and when to use Muggle Test.
- Then follow **[Quickstart: Running Your First Tests](./quickstart-running-tests.md)** to go from zero to your first successful run.

## If you want to understand the architecture

- Read **[How Muggle Test Works](/concepts/how-muggle-test-works.md)** to learn how discovery, scripts, runs, and reports fit together.

## If you plan to integrate via API

- Begin with **[API Overview](/api/api-overview.md)** for authentication, base URLs, and common patterns.
- Then see **[Running Tests via API](/api/running-tests-via-api.md)** to trigger runs and fetch results programmatically.

## If you are troubleshooting

- Check **[Common Issues & Fixes](/troubleshooting/common-issues.md)** for answers to the most frequent setup and runtime problems.

From here, you can always use the in-app sidebar search to jump directly to topics, or browse the sections listed on the left.
